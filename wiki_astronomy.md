# Astronomy 

Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the
phenomena that occur in the cosmos. It uses mathematics, physics, and
chemistry in order to explain their origin and their overall evolution.
Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies,
meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova
explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic
microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies
everything that originates beyond Earth\'s atmosphere. Cosmology is a
branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.

Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations
in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These
include the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Maya, and
many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy
included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation,
observational astronomy, and the making of calendars.

Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical
branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from
observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using
basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward
the development of computer or analytical models to describe
astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each
other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and
observations are used to confirm theoretical results.

Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. 
This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. 
Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.

## Etymology

Astronomy (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron, \"star\" and
-νομία -nomia from νόμος nomos, \"law\" or \"culture\") means \"law of
the stars\" (or \"culture of the stars\" depending on the translation).
Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which
claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial
objects.\[2\] Although the two fields share a common origin, they are
now entirely distinct.\[3\]

### Use of terms "astronomy" and "astrophysics"

\"Astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" are synonyms.\[4\]\[5\]\[6\] Based on
strict dictionary definitions, \"astronomy\" refers to \"the study of
objects and matter outside the Earth\'s atmosphere and of their physical
and chemical properties\",\[7\] while \"astrophysics\" refers to the
branch of astronomy dealing with \"the behavior, physical properties,
and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena\".\[8\] In some
cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical
Universe by Frank Shu, \"astronomy\" may be used to describe the
qualitative study of the subject, whereas \"astrophysics\" is used to
describe the physics-oriented version of the subject.\[9\] However,
since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to
physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics.\[4\]
Some fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also
astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research
on this subject may use \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\", partly
depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a
physics department,\[5\] and many professional astronomers have physics
rather than astronomy degrees.\[6\] Some titles of the leading
scientific journals in this field include The Astronomical Journal, The
Astrophysical Journal, and Astronomy & Astrophysics.

## History 

### Ancient times

In early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions 
of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures 
assembled massive artifacts that may have had some astronomical purpose. 
In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to 
determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.[10]
Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. 
As civilizations developed, most notably in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, and Central America, 
astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. 
Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. 
From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, 
Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe 
with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.[11]
A particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, 
which began among the Babylonians, who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that 
developed in many other civilizations.[13] The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a 
repeating cycle known as a saros.[14]
Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. 
Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena.[15] 
In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, 
and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, 
now called the heliocentric model.[16] In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, 
calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices 
such as the astrolabe.[17] Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, 
and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy.[18] 
The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, 
Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, 
when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.[19]

### Middle Ages

Medieval Europe housed a number of important astronomers. Richard of Wallingford (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the Rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an equatorium called the Albion which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses. Nicole Oresme (1320–1382) and Jean Buridan (1300–1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of inertia) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels.[20] Georg von Peuerbach (1423–1461) and Regiomontanus (1436–1476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later.

Astronomy flourished in the Islamic world and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the Muslim world by the early 9th century.[21][22][23] In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars.[24] The SN 1006 supernova, the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and Chinese astronomers in 1006. Iranian scholar Al-Biruni observed that, contrary to Ptolemy, the Sun's apogee (highest point in the heavens) was mobile, not fixed.[25] Some of the prominent Islamic (mostly Persian and Arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include Al-Battani, Thebit, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, Biruni, Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī, Al-Birjandi, and the astronomers of the Maragheh and Samarkand observatories. Astronomers during that time introduced many Arabic names now used for individual stars.[26][27]

It is also believed that the ruins at Great Zimbabwe and Timbuktu[28] may have housed astronomical observatories.[29] In Post-classical West Africa, Astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens as well as precise diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations. Songhai historian Mahmud Kati documented a meteor shower in August 1583.[30][31] Europeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in sub-Saharan Africa during the pre-colonial Middle Ages, but modern discoveries show otherwise.[32][33][34][35]
