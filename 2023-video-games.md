# 2023 in video games

In the video game industry, 2023 saw significant changes within larger
publishers and developers. Microsoft, after having satisfied worldwide
regulatory bodies, completed its US\$69 billion acquisition of
Activision Blizzard, making them the third largest game publisher in the
world. Embracer Group, which had been in an acquisition spree over the
previous few years, had an estimated \$2 billion deal fall through,
causing many of the studios under Embracer to either lay off staff or
close entirely. Similar layoffs were seen at Unity, Amazon, ByteDance,
Epic Games, Bungie, and Ubisoft, leading to over 9,000 jobs lost in the
industry in 2023 and part of a larger trend of layoffs at technology
companies in 2023.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]
