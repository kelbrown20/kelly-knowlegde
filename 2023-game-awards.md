# The Game awards 2023

The Game Awards 2023 was an award show that honored the best video games
of 2023. It was the tenth show hosted by Geoff Keighley, creator and
producer of The Game Awards, held with a live audience at the Peacock
Theater in Los Angeles, California, on December 7, 2023. The preshow
ceremony was hosted by Sydnee Goodman. The event was live streamed
across online platforms globally. It featured musical performances from
Loren Allred, Heilung, and Old Gods of Asgard, and presentations from
celebrity guests, including Timothée Chalamet, Christopher Judge, and
Matthew McConaughey.

Baldur\'s Gate 3 led the show with nine nominations and six wins,
including Game of the Year and Best Performance for Neil Newbon. Several
new games were announced during the show, including Marvel\'s Blade,
Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and Visions of Mana. The show was viewed by
over 118 million streams, the most in its history, with more than 17,000
co-streams from content creators. Journalists criticized the show for
prioritizing announcements and celebrities over awards, and its lack of
acknowledgement of industry layoffs and the ongoing Gaza humanitarian
crisis.

## Background

As with previous iterations of The Game Awards, the 2023 show was hosted
and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley.\[2\] He
returned as an executive producer alongside Kimmie Kim, and Richard
Preuss and LeRoy Bennett returned as director and creative director,
respectively.\[3\] Sydnee Goodman returned as host of the 30-minute
preshow, titled Opening Act.\[4\] The presentation took place at the
Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, California, on December 7, 2023,\[2\]
and was live streamed across more than 30 online platforms globally,
including Instagram, Facebook, Steam, TikTok, Twitch, X, and
YouTube.\[5\]\[6\]

Public tickets became available for purchase on November 6,\[3\] and
sold out within a week,\[7\] quicker than any previous year.\[8\] The
show increased security following stage interruptions at the previous
ceremony in December 2022 and Gamescom\'s Opening Night Live in August
2023.\[9\] Keighley said the show and preshow aimed for a collective
three-hour runtime, like its predecessor.\[4\] The Game Awards 2023 was
the fourth show to feature Future Class, a list of 50 individuals from
across the video game industry who best represent its future. The list
was announced on December 5, featuring individuals like Marvel\'s
Midnight Suns writer Emma Kidwell, The Sims 4 experience design lead
Alister Lee, and accessibility consultant Ross Minor.\[10\]

## Winners and nominees 

Nominees were announced on November 13, 2023.\[12\] Any game released
for public consumption on or before November 17 was eligible for
consideration. The nominees were compiled by a jury panel composed of
members from over 100 media outlets globally. Specialized juries decided
the nominees for categories such as accessibility, adaptation, and
esports.\[13\] Winners were determined between the jury (90 percent) and
public voting (10 percent); the latter was held via the official website
and Discord server\[a\] until December 6.\[14\]\[15\] The exception is
the Players\' Voice award, fully nominated and voted-on by the public,
for which voting opened on November 27.\[16\] According to Keighley,
first-day website voting saw a 73% increase over the previous year.\[8\]

The Game Awards partnered with Nighttimes and Studio 568 to create an
in-game hub world in Fortnite, available from November 14, allowing
players to vote for their favorite user-created islands among ten
nominees; the winner was announced during the ceremony. Keighley had
been seeking to create more in-game events since hosting a live show in
Fortnite in 2019,\[17\]\[18\] and sought to allow in-game live
viewership of the show in the future. He felt it was a more effective
advertising technique for the show than traditional marketing like
billboards.\[8\] According to Keighley, the hub world surpassed one
million plays within three days, with more than 875,000 unique
players.\[19\]

## Reception
### Nominees

Some journalists were surprised by Cyberpunk 2077\'s four
nominations---twice as many as its original nominations in
2021---particularly due to the game\'s troubled launch.\[38\]\[39\] Many
considered Destiny 2\'s Best Community Support nomination poorly timed,
coming weeks after layoffs at developer Bungie, including much of its
community team.\[40\]\[41\]\[42\] Journalists felt several performances
were overlooked and suggested Best Performance be split to consider
leading and supporting performances to widen its
scope.\[43\]\[44\]\[45\] TheGamer\'s Stacey Henley found Pizza Tower\'s
nomination for Best Debut Indie Game but not Best Independent Game
incongruous.\[46\]

The absence of nominations for Chained Echoes was highlighted as a flaw
in the eligibility period for games released the preceding
December;\[47\]\[48\] some writers opined the show had a recency bias,
with half the Game of the Year nominees released in October.\[43\]\[49\]
Many reporters and players highlighted the sole nomination for
Starfield, a blockbuster game from a reputable
developer,\[25\]\[38\]\[50\] though some found it appropriate due to the
game\'s lesser quality compared to its competition.\[49\]\[51\] The lack
of nominations for Hogwarts Legacy was similarly highlighted, with some
citing the game\'s divisiveness as a possible reason,\[38\]\[52\] though
others felt it was due to its relative quality.\[48\]\[53\]\[54\] Some
lamented the omission of Octopath Traveler 2,\[38\]\[55\]\[56\] and
others felt Final Fantasy XVI was snubbed a Game of the Year
nomination.\[48\]\[57\]

Several journalists and viewers expressed confusion at Dave the Diver\'s
Best Independent Game nomination as its developer, Mintrocket, is a
subsidiary of the larger company Nexon, which previously claimed the
game was \"not necessarily\" an indie;\[43\]\[46\] TheGamer\'s Henley
wrote that Baldur\'s Gate 3 was \"technically an entirely independent
game\" but was likely not considered eligible due to developer Larian
Studios\'s employee count and use of an existing intellectual
property.\[46\] In response, Keighley said \"independent can mean
different things to different people\" and opted to allow the jury to
decide the final selections.\[58\] TheGamer\'s Jade King called Games
for Impact \"a locker to stuff all the diverse games into\", with four
of its six nominees not receiving any other nominations, and felt it was
typically limited to independent games despite others fitting the
criteria.\[59\]

### Ceremony
Before the ceremony, more than 3,000 game industry members, including 79
previous Future Class recipients\[60\]---more than half of the 150
members to date\[61\]---signed an open letter calling for a statement to
be read during the show addressing the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis,
supporting the rights of Palestinians and calling for a ceasefire, and
asking the industry to address the dehumanization of people from South
West Asia and North Africa and their portrayal as villains or terrorists
in games. The letter\'s author, 2021 Future Class recipient Younès
Rabii, said it was motivated by Meg Jayanth\'s withdrawal as a presenter
at the Golden Joystick Awards in October after being barred from making
a statement about Palestinians.\[62\]\[63\]\[64\] The Mary Sue\'s Ana
Valens bemoaned the show\'s lack of response\[65\] and Paste\'s Garrett
Martin criticized it as \"cowardly\".\[60\] Rock Paper Shotgun\'s Alice
Bell felt the show only would have voiced support if it \"was a
profitable stance rather than a moral one\".\[66\] After the ceremony,
developers of nominees Goodbye Volcano High and Venba said they had
planned to acknowledge the crisis in their acceptance speeches.\[1\]
Keighley spoke with Future Class members after the show; some members
felt he was deflective and unprepared, while others found the meeting
productive and hopeful.\[67\]\[68\]

The ceremony was criticized for prioritizing announcements and celebrity
guests over nominees and winners.\[69\]\[72\]\[73\] Some journalists
felt this was represented by actor Timothée Chalamet presenting Game of
the Year instead of a game developer.\[61\]\[69\] Obsidian Entertainment
director Josh Sawyer called the show \"an embarrassing indictment of a
segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power with
little respect for the devs it\'s supposedly honoring\".\[1\]
Eurogamer\'s Chris Tapsell felt future ceremonies should mirror the
goals of its own industry rather than seek validation and relevance from
others.\[61\] Video Games Chronicle\'s Andy Robinson empathized with the
production team\'s challenges and considered the show among the best to
date but felt it suffered from runtime and curation problems.\[74\]
VentureBeat\'s Dean Takahashi felt the show \"lived up to the reputation
of being \... the Oscars of gaming\".\[75\] Some commentators considered
highlights included Old Gods of Asgard\'s performance\[70\]\[76\]\[77\]
and Abubakar Salim announcing Tales of Kenzera: Zau in memory of his
late father.\[73\]\[70\]\[78\]

Journalists found it disrespectful that celebrity guests were given
several minutes to speak---including more than six minutes for Hideo
Kojima and Jordan Peele\[79\]---while winners were allocated thirty
seconds before being prompted to \"wrap it up\" and cut off by
music,\[1\]\[66\]\[80\] and others were relegated to the preshow or
announced in quick succession without acceptance
speeches.\[73\]\[72\]\[70\] The Escapist\'s Liam Nolan calculated that
winners\' speeches cumulatively ran for less than 11 minutes, compared
to the Academy Awards\'s 30-minute average.\[81\] Commentators cited
Best Performance winner Neil Newbon being cut off while talking about
players\' heartfelt responses to his work, and Game of the Year acceptee
Swen Vincke while paying tribute to his deceased
colleague,\[1\]\[70\]\[71\] and considered it disrespectful considering
several acceptees speak English as a second language.\[69\]\[82\]\[83\]
Keighley said he asked his team to relax the rule during the show and
acknowledged it would be addressed in future.\[1\] GameSpot and IGN
published speeches from winners who were unable to accept at the
show.\[84\]\[85\]

Critics bemoaned the show\'s lack of acknowledgement of the video game
industry\'s mass layoffs;\[1\]\[88\]\[82\] VentureBeat\'s Rachel Kaser
found it particularly disappointing considering the show\'s focus on
film and television industry professionals,\[89\] and The Verge\'s Ash
Parrish wrote that \"Keighley let video game developers down\".\[88\]
Dot Esports\'s Issy van der Velde called it \"disappointing but not
entirely unexpected\" based on the show\'s history of avoiding
acknowledgment.\[90\] Game Developer\'s Chris Kerr criticized
Keighley\'s opening speech for calling for unity but failing to address
layoffs, and felt the show should spend \"less time chasing a hollow
sense of legitimacy by curating a showcase that has the cultural
awareness and humanity of a shameless Super Bowl ad\".\[91\] The
ceremony was picketed by pro-worker protestors advocating for
unionization, including members of the Game Workers of Southern
California and SAG-AFTRA;\[70\]\[86\]\[87\] one picket sign read \"best
year for games, worst year for game workers\".\[91\]

Some Call of Duty developers criticized presenter Christopher Judge\'s
joke that his 2022 acceptance speech was lengthier than Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare III\'s (2023) single-player story
campaign.\[92\]\[93\]\[94\] Current and former developers countered by
citing Call of Duty\'s higher commercial success, though some deleted
