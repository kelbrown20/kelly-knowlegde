# The Game awards 2023

The Game Awards 2023 was an award show that honored the best video games
of 2023. It was the tenth show hosted by Geoff Keighley, creator and
producer of The Game Awards, held with a live audience at the Peacock
Theater in Los Angeles, California, on December 7, 2023. The preshow
ceremony was hosted by Sydnee Goodman. The event was live streamed
across online platforms globally. It featured musical performances from
Loren Allred, Heilung, and Old Gods of Asgard, and presentations from
celebrity guests, including Timothée Chalamet, Christopher Judge, and
Matthew McConaughey.

Baldur\'s Gate 3 led the show with nine nominations and six wins,
including Game of the Year and Best Performance for Neil Newbon. Several
new games were announced during the show, including Marvel\'s Blade,
Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and Visions of Mana. The show was viewed by
over 118 million streams, the most in its history, with more than 17,000
co-streams from content creators. Journalists criticized the show for
prioritizing announcements and celebrities over awards, and its lack of
acknowledgement of industry layoffs and the ongoing Gaza humanitarian
crisis.

## Background

As with previous iterations of The Game Awards, the 2023 show was hosted
and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley.\[2\] He
returned as an executive producer alongside Kimmie Kim, and Richard
Preuss and LeRoy Bennett returned as director and creative director,
respectively.\[3\] Sydnee Goodman returned as host of the 30-minute
preshow, titled Opening Act.\[4\] The presentation took place at the
Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, California, on December 7, 2023,\[2\]
and was live streamed across more than 30 online platforms globally,
including Instagram, Facebook, Steam, TikTok, Twitch, X, and
YouTube.\[5\]\[6\]

Public tickets became available for purchase on November 6,\[3\] and
sold out within a week,\[7\] quicker than any previous year.\[8\] The
show increased security following stage interruptions at the previous
ceremony in December 2022 and Gamescom\'s Opening Night Live in August
2023.\[9\] Keighley said the show and preshow aimed for a collective
three-hour runtime, like its predecessor.\[4\] The Game Awards 2023 was
the fourth show to feature Future Class, a list of 50 individuals from
across the video game industry who best represent its future. The list
was announced on December 5, featuring individuals like Marvel\'s
Midnight Suns writer Emma Kidwell, The Sims 4 experience design lead
Alister Lee, and accessibility consultant Ross Minor.\[10\]

## Winners and nominees 

Nominees were announced on November 13, 2023.\[12\] Any game released
for public consumption on or before November 17 was eligible for
consideration. The nominees were compiled by a jury panel composed of
members from over 100 media outlets globally. Specialized juries decided
the nominees for categories such as accessibility, adaptation, and
esports.\[13\] Winners were determined between the jury (90 percent) and
public voting (10 percent); the latter was held via the official website
and Discord server\[a\] until December 6.\[14\]\[15\] The exception is
the Players\' Voice award, fully nominated and voted-on by the public,
for which voting opened on November 27.\[16\] According to Keighley,
first-day website voting saw a 73% increase over the previous year.\[8\]

The Game Awards partnered with Nighttimes and Studio 568 to create an
in-game hub world in Fortnite, available from November 14, allowing
players to vote for their favorite user-created islands among ten
nominees; the winner was announced during the ceremony. Keighley had
been seeking to create more in-game events since hosting a live show in
Fortnite in 2019,\[17\]\[18\] and sought to allow in-game live
viewership of the show in the future. He felt it was a more effective
advertising technique for the show than traditional marketing like
billboards.\[8\] According to Keighley, the hub world surpassed one
million plays within three days, with more than 875,000 unique
players.\[19\]
